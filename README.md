To run ensure you have downloaded python. Any new-ish version should work. I would recommend running this in its own folder as it will create a csv file. <u>**This csv file does not update and just gets overwritten.**</u>
This repo is the source code for your reading pleasure should you understandably not trust me. Run this in terminal as you would normally run a python file. If you need assistance setting it up please contact me over Discord.
Please send me your csv file upon running the code so I can gett all acquired data into one csv for later use on this project.
